Crypto
======

This is just a library of cryptographic and number theoretic functions for a crytpography class I am currentl taking. It includes implementations of algorithms for:

1) Primality Testing (miller-rabin) 

2) Factoring (Pollard-Rho method with Flyod cycle detection)

3) Modular Exponentiation (Russian Peasant) 

4) GCD (Euclidean algorithm, extended Euclidean algorithm)

5) Discrete Logarithm (Baby step giant step algorithm) <br/>
   a) I'm still working on this one. It's not quite done. 

6) More to come!!
